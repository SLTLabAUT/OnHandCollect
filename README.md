# Online Handwriting Collection (OnHandCollect)
This repository is the web app for https://FarsiHandwriting.ir/, a crowdsourcing platform for collecting online handwritings to create a public domain dataset for training handwriting recognition-related tools.

The dataset is available on the [POH-Db](https://github.com/SLTLabAUT/POH-Db) repository.
